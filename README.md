# LogisticRegression_PassFailPredictor

# âœ… Logistic Regression â€“ Pass/Fail Prediction Based on Study Hours

A simple classification project using **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a student will **pass or fail** based on how many hours they studied.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
| Hours Studied | Result (Pass=1 / Fail=0) |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| 1             | 0                         |
| 2             | 0                         |
| 3             | 0                         |
| 4             | 0                         |
| 5             | 1                         |
| 6             | 1                         |
| 7             | 1                         |
| 8             | 1                         |

## ðŸ“Œ Goal
To understand how **Logistic Regression** can be used for **binary classification** tasks.

## ðŸ“š Concepts Covered
- Classification vs Regression
- Logistic Regression Theory
- Sigmoid Function
- Model Accuracy
- Probability Prediction
- Plotting the Decision Curve

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Used
- `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn`
- Binary classification: `0` for Fail, `1` for Pass
